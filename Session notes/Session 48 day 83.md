 We continue on our trip with [[Rafael von brokli]] towards [[Mudwip]] and we meet a fork in the road, one leading towards [[Crossguard]] and one to [[Mudwip]]. This is where we part ways with Rafael.
 Rafael mentioned a status by the coastline near [[Custonia]], he also mentions the Bards College and the Inn [[Harbours Delight]] in Mudwip.

From Azuth's lore I know that the town is half the size it was before the cataclysm.

As we head towards Mudwip alone, we see old farm houses and fields. We can see that a lot of the vegetation and marchlands are quite new. We meet two guards riding the opposite direction that we're going. They stop to ask some questions before moving on.
As I take one more step on the road my feet start falling into the road. I'm stuck an a thick fog surrounds me and covers everything. The light disappear completely. Time slows down for me. I feel a sharp pain in my neck and my vision blurs. Vines spew out of my mouth.
Maeve tries to heal me and she sees eyes that she has seen before, it's [[lukumoreh]].
I grab hold of the Sigil of Lukumoreh. I see his three skulls and his antlers clearly. The vines are crawling over my body and Lukumoreh is fighting to help me from [[Zargeth]].
He gives me a week or maybe two in this area. Lukumoreh sounds very human, almost like someone else is in there with him.
I come back to reality and tell the others. But in the distance I can still see the fog in the distance an lukumoreh pointing towards the road. But I'm still thinking about the humanoid voice I heard.
[[Azuth Wildmane]] gags and we continue moving.
We get to Mudwip and the city has a large wall with torches all the way down it. It's like a last bastion against the surrounding landscape.
The larger trees around the city have been cut down, to make sure the trees doesn't take over the city. There are choking vines on the city wall.
The inside of the city are wooden houses covered in growth and there are ruins of a cathedral or large tower building in the water. The guard at the gate says that there's a festival-thingy going on, the Harvest Delight, where bards from the college play music. [[Notes of Nightingale]] is the weekly music play.
The reason for the buildings under water is because of the cataclysm, where the gods caused the sea to grow and swallow part of Mudwip.

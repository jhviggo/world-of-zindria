 We continue on our trip with [[Rafael von brokli]] towards [[Mudwip]] and we meet a fork in the road, one leading towards [[Crossguard]] and one to [[Mudwip]]. This is where we part ways with Rafael.
 Rafael mentioned a status by the coastline near [[Custonia]], he also mentions the Bards College and the Inn [[Harbours Delight]] in Mudwip.

From Azuth's lore I know that the town is half the size it was before the cataclysm.

As we head towards Mudwip alone, we see old farm houses and fields. We can see that a lot of the vegetation and marchlands are quite new. We meet two guards riding the opposite direction that we're going. They stop to ask some questions before moving on.
As I take one more step on the road my feet start falling into the road. I'm stuck an a thick fog surrounds me and covers everything. The light disappear completely. Time slows down for me. I feel a sharp pain in my neck and my vision blurs. Vines spew out of my mouth.
Maeve tries to heal me and she sees eyes that she has seen before, it's [[lukumoreh]].
I grab hold of the Sigil of Lukumoreh. I see his three skulls and his antlers clearly. The vines are crawling over my body and Lukumoreh is fighting to help me from [[Zargeth]].
He gives me a week or maybe two in this area. Lukumoreh sounds very human, almost like someone else is in there with him.
I come back to reality and tell the others. But in the distance I can still see the fog in the distance an lukumoreh pointing towards the road. But I'm still thinking about the male humanoid voice I heard.
[[Azuth Wildmane]] gags and we continue moving.
We get to Mudwip and the city has a large wall with torches all the way down it. It's like a last bastion against the surrounding landscape.
The larger trees around the city have been cut down, to make sure the trees doesn't take over the city. There are choking vines on the city wall.
The inside of the city are wooden houses covered in growth and there are ruins of a cathedral or large tower building in the water. The guard at the gate says that there's a festival-thingy going on, the Harvest Delight, where bards from the college play music. [[Notes of Nightingale]] is the weekly music play.
The reason for the buildings under water is because of the cataclysm, where the gods caused the sea to grow and swallow part of Mudwip.
As we get to the Inn we see a large wooden building and inside there's a large hall full of people. And there's a paintings high up by the roof. There's a staircase leading up to a bar area. There is one individual standing by a table. A white-haired female elf with long ears and black flowers in them and a cresant moon symbol on her forehead and multiple sets of amulets. There's a second person sitting at the table next to her. She nods to me and to the person sitting down, and then walking out the back.
Azuth walks over to the table and there's a blue-skinned elf. A new Player :D
Human half-elf woman, blue tone and tons of tattoos. She asks about the symbol of Luna. [[Messina Moonglade]] from the [[Moon Weavers]] and a follower of [[Lady Luna]]. She has something to do with Maeve's Crystal.
Missina has met with 3 druid circles and made a plan. There are 3 [[Grass Blades Order]] leaders which we need to take care of before we can deal with [[Zargeth]] aka The old oak. Each druid circle has been given a leader to deal with. We have been tasked with dealing with [[Illiana Hawkside]] the Ranger. Azuth knows that there are 4 leaders that rule the regions of the Grass blades. Azuth will know where to track down 3 leaders but the last one is hidden.
The [[Moon Weavers]] try not to interfere with the world, but when greater powers threaten the balance, like the Old Oak, they do interfere. Messina explains that the amulets, like Maeve's amulet, are given to people from the moon weavers and signal that the person has been blessed by Lady Luna.
The music plays in the background from a young elven bard on the stage. A brown-haired woman announces at stage that the stage will be open to newcomers. Her name is [[Marcia Bellhaven]] and her husband is in the corner.
Voldooron decides to go on stage and play some music, as we were talking about it Marcia hears and says she'll be his backup musician. As they go towards the stage the Tiefling husband comes from behind the bar and joins them on stage.
Voldooron absolutely aces it with a roll of 30. A lot of note-takers in the bar come up to voldooron. [[Professor Calefore]] comes up and introduces himself.  They ask if he wants to play in Crossguard, Iridium and other places. They give him a bunch of recommendations for colleges and different cities to play in.
We get free beds to sleep in because of Voldoorons amazing performance.
We ask Messina about here abilities and she summons her bone [[Soulknife]] she uses in combat. She's a rogue-like druid.
I try to listen for the voice I heard in my vision. The people around me have quite a refined accents but the voice in my vision was from an older man not from here. Messina knows that he sounds like [[Detric Ironbark]], one of the counselers of the [[Aborial counsel]]. The third circle is called the [[Deep Root Keepers]].
We decide that tomorrow we'll get up early, get breakfast, go shopping and then head into the woods towards the Grass Blades.

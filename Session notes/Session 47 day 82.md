We leave Lorium in the morning and continue towards Gradia. Dubh realizes that one more of the [[Forsaken Ravens]] might be alive, as they knew a guardsman who wasn't at the party at [[Aroma Atlas]]. It's the guard that Dubh met at the Mansion that taught him to use a crossbow.
Dubh goes up to tell a story to [[Rafael von brokli]] and tell him about all that happened with the Ravens and [[Zanzel (dead)]].
Rafael mentions that Mudwip has being engulfed by the surrounding woods, but the trees feel ominous or odd. He also tells other stories of where he has been.
We get to a lumbering town, Gradia, where we see larger houses built from Lumber and it almost blends into the nearby woods and surroundings. In the town center there's a large bell tower, in a wooden tower with a golden bell at the top. It's later in the day and people are stopping their work, so we'll stay here a few hours before driving for Mudwip through the night.

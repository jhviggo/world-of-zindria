In the dark arena we're fighting mirror images of our selves, and Maeve stabbed me in the ribs and cast fire on me twice.
We pulled glowing crystals out of the pillars.

We see a man dressed in black with raven-theme gear. He's very pale with dark brown beard and hair in a pony tail. He has some leather armor on and has a large crow on his shoulder.
Next to him is a tiny Lizard (Zim) about half his size. White scale and an angled hat.

Dubh brings a message to [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]]. A man, the players met at the [[Heaven Manor]], from the [[Mages of Divinity]] who's Whitmoores old professor.

Zim, the lizard, walks up to me and starts to grow and turn into an image of me and can cast my spells. He heals us up.

Dubh asks why the [[Mages of Divinity]] would be hunting us so much.

The [[Forsaken Ravens]] is a group that gathers magic. Starting in [[Iridium]] the Masters of the Ravens were students in the same year. [[Master Pandelume (dead)]], [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]] and two more [[Becken]] and [[Elia]]. They were all very good at their perspective magics learning much knowledge of the Arcana. They realized that the university was withholding knowledge from the world. They didn't think that was fair, so they grouped together. They were smuggling books out of the university giving them to people leaving iridium, until one of the professors at the university found out. This professor is now part of the mages of divinity. A lot of students were part of the group, but they became fewer and fewer. But they kept going until one of the students died due to the conflicts. Afterwards the masters were banished from Iridium, but they didn't have any money.
[[Master Whitmoore (dead)]] kept at it and kept researching on his own.
[[Master Pandelume (dead)]] joined a school and eventually found a sponsor for the Ravens. They wanted to help with food, housing and such. The only catch was that they could only be in contact with the sponsor. Pandaloon was the only one who knew where the money came from. At this point the ravens had  multiple hideouts and lots of members.
The sponsors also wanted a future favor, which the Ravens could not say no to. Master Pandelume also found something secret in the Crimson Savana, which could harm the mages of divinity.
The favor finally came and was simply to distract the mages of divinity, so the sponsor could sneak something past them. That's why the mages are now hunting us, because the Ravens got their attention and they're hunting Dubh.
From what Whitmoore knows, the sponsors succede whatever they were doing.

Voldooron mentioned some confrontation, during a break-in, the players had with [[Lady Starbrim]], but she's not part of the Mages or the Ravens.

at [[Heaven Manor]] they rescued some people who said that [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]] would know where [[Master Pandelume (dead)]] was, but he says that it's confidential.
Pandelume has been very interested in the Crimson Savana, but we don't know why. Whitmoore can help us get to one of the settlements nearby if that helps ([[Ra'tir]], [[Emiqz]], [[Red-Razkar]] or [[Chariz]])

Dubh takes our a Leon Spear, which the mages used to disspell us. [[Nuani Hunters]] are the makers of the spar, they're very good at fighting magic users.

Pandelume has probably keep captured. He had said that he was going to a camp in the Savana, which was controlled by the mages of divinity. he wanted to infiltrate the camp, and if did not come back, then he was probably captured. Therefore the Ravens went into hiding.

It seems that the church of the crimson savana are worried about Tabaxi with black fur, such as Dubh.

Whitmoore asks about an artifact among us, he's being very defensive. It's Maeves crystal.
The last person to touch it died, he was a professor. Someone had cast a spell on the crystal to protect Maeve, the spell block scrying.
Someone tried to Scrye on the gem, someone very powerfull, probably more powerful than Whitmoore.

He mentions that a Quill master is an honorary title you can get once you master an art. He's preparing a thesis to present to the previous quill masters. This title is from Vasselheim.

We're planning on Going to [[Chariz]] with Whitmoore's help.

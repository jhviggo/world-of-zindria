We're in the ogre/gnoll cave.

There was a blond tabaxi girl traqpped in the cave (hunter's sister). The gnoll leader gave her a potion, which swapped her place with a guy.
[[Marcus meridius]] stopped our fight in the cave. He's basically a witcher with blond hair, hunters outfit and potions. He takes orders from some women, not because he has to but because he wants to.
He took another potion and which teleported him back. he had a bunch of potions in the jacket and Dubh recognized some of them.
The hunter wrapped his sister in some fabric and wanted to bring her back to the camp, the other hunter follows us. The camp we were in was for people who wanted to live peacefully away from others.

We leave the camp by the other exit and come out to a more peaceful place with green bushes and stuff.
We have a greater short rest.

We continue traveling towards [[Master Whitmoore]] and we're trying to find the right entrance.
The hunter finds the entrance after a while. There's a huge open cave. There are signs of activity by the entrance. We're at the [[wailing caverns]]. We can hear a low wailing sound going through the cave.
The hunter will go back to his camp and not lead us further. The tells us that Master Whitmoore is a wizard and he probably has counter measures/traps.

We go deep into the cave and suddenly enter a magic shield that blocks our magic. Dubh walks into the shield and casts detect magic and everything is magic around him.
Inside the magic shield there's a huge opening.

Maeve turned into a beetle and climbed in my pocket and Nim jumped on my back, so we could go into the dark together. We stepped forward and all got teleported into the fucking shadow realm with weird thingies on the rocks. I see a Maeve in the distance but she doesn't respond to me. She's also out of her beetle form.

### Memories from the Crimson Savana
Dubh has good memories of this area. He remembers seeing the cloud from the crimson storm and he remembers a tabaxi woman with black fur. He remembers being held by the edge on a cliff, looking over the desert at the storm with his mom. Finally he remembers two fangs, dripping golden blood (part of his nightmare from a Leonin or Tabaxi), before his memories fade away.

Dubh wakes up in his dream. He sees a red light outside the multi-room tent and he walks towards the entrance of the tent. It's pouring down and thundering. He's terrified because he sees a shadow figure in each room around him.  He walks out and into the inn tent and sees the eye of the storm above him, familiar purple arcs from the crimson storm spread out around him. He sees the figures around him. He's seen these statues before in his dream in front of a temple. Every time the lightning flashes the statues face him. he sees a large figure behind him. He sees the golden fangs with golden blood dripping towards the floor.
The figure says he must join the hunt and fell the prey in an ominous voice. Dubh is part of them and their heritage, and he must become stronger to join the hunt. It'll give him a new power if he accepts. It's the same being that gave him strength 5 years ago. He has to hunt the thing that has created, betrayed and abandoned them. Dubh's destiny beholds the thing he must hunt. He accepted the ritual to become a part of [[Hell walkers]]!

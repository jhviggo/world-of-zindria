I'm still producing silk out of my butt with Maeve helping xD

The first plateau has been built as well as the first elevator. Nim went out and found some animals and carts from the citizen. We have to ferry 2.5k citizen down.
The dwarven ride Brombear boars that have crossbows mounted on them.
Voldooron came up with the idea of making darts to throw at the enemy. The town didn't have any explosives or flamable things like oil, which we could throw at the dwarves.

Over the next few sessions we have to roll for the workers, to see how well they're working and if they make it through the nights without any accidents. Dubh rolled a nat 20 at first, so construction is going great so far.
The next morning he rolled a 2 :) Heck.
Because of the roll, the workers spotted a dwarven scouting party at the bottom of the cliff. We have to construct some fortification at the bottom of the cliff to keep the scouts away.

Maeve and I tried to conjure animals. We ended up summoning 16 huskies in the desert... So we sent them to attack the dwarven camp and the doggos got smacked. They did nothing to the camp. Ruru also scouted the area and found multiple dwarven camps with around 10 creatures in each. About 3 of the camps are pretty close to the construction site.

Next day we managed to summon 8 giant bats and 8 giant owls. There are some problems with a sandstone wall and an overhang cliff, so we have to help the workers. It took the owls and bats about 5min to ferry a person and equipment up and down the cliff. We have the animals follow Dubh and help him carry logs and resources to the construction site. Maeve and I turn into spiders and help the workers. Maeve is scared of herself because she doesn't like spiders lol.
The animals were carrying huge logs but they desummoned mid air and dropped the logs. 2 workers were crushed by the logs and died.
During the night we lose another 3 workers because one of the lifts collapsed and pulled out some wall anchors. We almost lost 4 but Maeve saved one of them with her healing. A dwarven scouting party heard the lift crashing and checked it out. The workers attacked the dwarven and we lost 1 more worker.
[[Trolic]]'s son [[Lorin]] will join us for leaving the city. Zantra also paid us for the work with a bag containing 1 diamond, 250 gem stones and 1500 gold.
I go to the leather shop and ask for some water container for the trip. They gave me some water pouches and voldooron also got some water barrels from the blacksmith.
We also ask Zantra's girlfriend to join us to keep us safe and to make sure she escapes the city. Zantra shows up at the construction site carrying her girlfriend Nylah. Zantra has a big scratch mark on her face, not dangerous looking, just a light scratch. Nylah probably got mad because Zantra told her she had to leave with us.
I summon 8 owls and start ferrying people down, in the midst of that I see smoke in the distance from dwarves coming towards us. there are 9 dwarves on foot and 4 on large boars.

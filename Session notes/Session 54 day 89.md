It's time to kill [[Thalenor Brightclave]] soon.
We wake up in the tunnel with [[Salamon Deeproot]] and [[Keep ortrom]].
We get to the end of the tunnel and see a basement room of the palace, we enter and walk through a magical barrier. It's an illusion which hides the entrance of the tunnel. We open the door and go up the stairs. The inside of the castle is made of [[Dark mold]] which darkens the castle a bit. There are rivers and channels running through the hall with grass on the floor and trees for pillars. There are a bunch of people, but they're not real, they're made of wood and roots. But Ez detected them, so they must be humanoid. They're elves that have passed away but sort of kept alive by the old oak. When I come near they come alive but only I can see and walk to them. We continue and get to a main hall and hear Thalanor speaking upstairs.

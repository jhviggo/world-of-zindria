# During the campaign
I met with [[lukumoreh]] and found out that [[Zargeth]] tricked me to try and kill [[lukumoreh]]. But instead of killing him I helped him, and basically denounced my faith. He gave me an amulet to block my connection to [[Zargeth]] temporarily and would have to solve that.
After that I had the connection to [[Zargeth]] severed by high druid [[Cain Bern]] by a ritual which almost killed me. Cain pointed out that the severed connection may not be permeant, since my family has a blood contract.

# Early years
I grew up in a small secluded elven village, called [[Ashbalt Grove]] named after the forest itself, north-west of [[Mudwip]] in the [[Ashbalt Forest]] near the river running to Birford Lake, where the [[Grass Blades Order]] are located. My father was a great druid in the village and would often advise the village elders on important matters. Our village had been trying to get in contact with another elven villages, who were also practitioners of the old faith - however it never succeeded. My father believe that being close with the villages around us could prevent hardship and conflicts. He traveled north to the Singing Woods of Baris to establish contact with the other elven village, and he traveled to [[Mudwip]] to aid the people, keeping up relationships between villages.

**[early teens]**

I would often be in [[Ashbalt Grove]] with my best friend [[Varmil]]. He had a great interest in Arcane magic and would often spend his time reading books. Some of the elves in the village had Arcane knowledge, however none were strong Mages of any sort. So [[Varmil]] and I would sometimes venture to [[Mudwip]] in search of new reading material for him. Other times we would scour the woods for herbs I could use for my spells. We always had a lot of fun through the years and he even showed me how to detect magic.

**[mid teens]**

Apart from my friend [[Varmil]], I didn't have many friends in the village. As I grew up I would spend more and more time alone in the forest, where I found a comfort amongst the creatures of the wild. I had learned to talk to animals and would often use this to befriend the local animals. One day I even came across a wolf stuck in a trap, a rather simple trap probably set by a human. I attempted to calmed the wolf so I could release it and got a shy "thanks" as it ran off. 

## Trained by my father
My father's ([[Dereks Wildmane]]) responsibilities to the village took much of his time, however he also made sure he had time to be with his family and train me. He wanted me to become a great druid like him and he quickly noticed I had an affinity for shapeshifting. He would bring me on hunts deep in the forest looking for **wolves**, **bears**, **boars** and other wildlife. The training was harsh and he taught me how to fight like a wild beast. He wanted me to become strong and expand my power, so he would often not show restraint in our fights.

## Zargeth's contract
My father taught me Druidic magic so I could be strong enough to handle the power of [[Zargeth]] told me that it was the source of our power and that power would only grow stronger in me as I came of age. My family had a long time ago made a deal with this spirit to grant us magic, however it turned us into elves in the process. What exactly we were before I don't know, as my father would never tell me - He insisted all would become clear when once I was old enough. We have a contract with the spirit, so as long as we protected the spirit it would protect us. My father would sometimes tell me of his younger days, when the spirit sent him and his brethren on a mission to find the other spirits. They were all strong hunters, however the lands were dangerous and only my father had returned.

The spirit wanted to spread its branches, to strengthen its presence in the lands, and my family was bound by the contract to do its bidding. My father kept the contract locked away, which the key always on him.

## My mother
My mother, [[Mayrin Wildmane]], was a gently woman. She was not a powerful warrior but she knew a great deal about local plants and healing. She taught me how to search for herbs and use them, either as an offence or to aid others. She also helped my craft my first totem by carving great oak into the form of an a wise owl.

She was a loving person, always asking me to do no harm. She was a firm believer in the order of nature, where the beasts and elves lived side by side, and the spirits would protect the lands from harm.

# Parent's death
Not long before I entered adulthood, when I was around 85, something went wrong. My father was returning from a mission, and he had sent me a letter telling me he'd be home in a few days. He was taking a small detour through [[Mudwip]] for supplies, and then he would head straight back to the grove. But after a week he still hadn't returned, so my mother and I traveled to [[Mudwip]] to find him. When we neared the town we were met by a horrible sight. We found my father, murdered and put on display along thieves, murderes and other criminals. My mother and I rushed home to the grove, where she in a crazed state attempted to convince the elders to take action, to attack [[Mudwip]] for their actions. However the elders rejected, stating that violence would bring no good. The next few days were horrible but we managed. One day as I came home I saw the house had been ravaged, everything had been throw about and destroyed - and there was lots of blood. It seemed like there had been a fight but nobody was there. My mother wasn't there and neither was the contract...

# Living with the wolves
After the event I decided that I couldn't stay, as nowhere felt safe. Mudwip had seemingly murdered my father, my mother was gone and the elves refused to help. So I decided to leave the grove, and go deep into Ashbalt Forest.

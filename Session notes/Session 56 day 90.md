We wake up after a greater short rest in the Opulise Palace. We decide to summon 8 owls and fly out of the city, there are balistas near the palace and sea, but we fly inland and get out of range quickly.
We rode owls twice, for a total of two hours and ended up finding a small abandoned hut, where we rest. as we move on and out of the forest, we get to the road, summon horses and ride towards [[Mudwip]]. On the way we see a creature we know [[Master antelope]]. 
[[Maeve Luin]] also tells us that the [[Sky Monarchs]] may be hunting us and that [[Celia de Luinn]] told her.
We get to Mudwip and go straight to the inn.

We're standing at the edge of the [[Scourches Scarians]] in the [[Crimson Savannah]] somewhere between [[Chariz]] and [[Red-Razkar]]. Dubh sent a message to [[Master Pandelume]] and got a message back saying he wouldn't say much and didn't know where he way, and he sounded to be in trouble. Dubh got a signal back with a direction where the message came from.

We decide to follow the citizen of Chariz to make sure they make it to the next Red-Razkar. We hurry to find Nylah, Zantra's girlfriend. We have Dubh cast sending trying to contact [[Zantra]] to see if she's still alive. And she is in fact! The blue Furry lives!
Nylah slaps Dubh for being part of the plan to get her out of Chariz without her consent.
Nylah tells us that the Crimson Savannah is very dangerous this time of year. And there had been a lot of activity outside of the Dwarves. Each of the cities in the crimson savannah have chieftains and a lot of military resources had been allocated to Chariz, however these cheiftains didn't help Charix when it was attacked by the dwarves.
Nylah doesn't know that much about the scourches scarians, but she has heard stories that magic acts very weird after the storms. Some of the Druids and Shamans have trouble casting spells during the storms. Some creatures also come out to drain energy from the storms, these are called Bolt Chasers. There are also some dragon-type creatures that may give blessing and be friendly.
There was a clan that disappeared in the savannah a few years ago, a surviving black-furred fellow named Scar from that clan sometimes passed through Chariz.
After a rest, Nylah decides to go towards Red-Razkar and afterwards she'll go to [[Sar'efal]].

We head straight into the Scourches Scarians after Dubh's ping of Pandelume. Dubh rolled an 8 for the day roll, his best roll of the day. The Savannah has lush bushed and red rock formations with caves, crevasses and uneven terrain. The plants seem to spring out from nothing only this time of the year. It's stunningly beautiful.
There's a storm in the sky with lights that is heading towards us, it'll probably catch up with us in 1-2 days. The storms move around the savannah.
We see huge rocks floating in the air. There are vines going from the ground up to the rocks. There's a huge flower on top of the rock.
From the storm we see what looks like lightning, but we realize that something is moving in front of the storm.
Two creatures appear with two halos above their heads and a halo around its tail. It's creatures of pure Arcana. There lightning going through its body.
Dubh creates a magic hut under the flying boulder and we hide from the dragons. The storm comes over our hut and we're now inside the storm. We feel the vibration and lightning strikes above us. The tent is starting to break down and I summon 4 giant wasps to distract the dragons and we RUN for a cave nearby.
It didn't work and we're fighting the dragons. Dubh killed 2 dragons :clap:

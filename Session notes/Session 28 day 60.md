We meet [[Celia de Luinn]] in the [[Second Scabbard]] where she is about to leave the city. She asks us for a favor and introduces [[Nimoras Tyr Invenir aka Nim]] a fairly shy male elf in semi shabby clothes, asking if we can keep him in our group for a while. He has studied in [[Iridium]] as an arcane spell caster and was sponsored by house of [[sherwood]].

Maeve was given 500g to take care of him.

We also got ~70g from the race yesterday!

We were told we can find [[Reliah Lueveen]] at the local clan [[Runaway Muck]], that also have connections with [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]]. 

We asked [[Nimoras Tyr Invenir aka Nim]] some questions and nim is a little taken aback by it, acting fairly shy. She's mostly here to help protect Maeve.

We starting heading out to the café that Maeve and Reliah went to.
Maeve rolled poorly, but we got there in the end xD

We find the café called [[Gentle Gust]] and go inside and chat with Nim. He's from [[Meridian principality]] and wanted to explore the world. 

After breakfast we go out trying to find the [[Runaway Muck]] clan, so we can talk to [[Reliah Lueveen]]. We find the clan and see a Leonin sitting on a bar stool. He's wearing a fancy leather outfit and golden shoulder plates. And a large golden belt, with a saber. He stands out a lot.
We see Reliah sitting in the bar and someone who looks exactly like Miquel from [[Miguel Smoke House]], but it's not him. Might be his twin.
Reliah was talking to someone and it seems they are in a bad mood. So we're buying some beer to defuse the situation. Reliah is talking to [[Huntsman Drion]] and they accept our beer.
The [[Ashen Kin]] is the ones in [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]] and Drion is the leader's brother.
In return for a job we can have Drion lead us to Whitmoore.
The job is that a bunch of Gnolls have been setting up base in Drion's territory. And he doesn't have enough men to handle it. Drion sent us out with one of his men named Cross.

We go back to the Second Scabbard to pay for our rooms and stuff. And then we head out to the [[Luq'zaar Canyon]]. As we leave the city a lot of the clans have started packing up and are getting ready to leave for the war efforts. We saw the [[spiker clan]] and we mocked them. hehe.

We walked towards the canyon and all get hit by the sun and get fucken heat stroked. We walk in a line and order is Azuth (me), Nim, Dubh , Maeve and Voldooron. Maeve got hit by something and takes 20 damage. I turn around and see a huge spider looming over the group on a stone bridge.

Battle time! Fuck spiders

After a long and hard fight, Voldooron died to the spiders. Right after we see a golden creature we have never seen before, two Spinx come leading Voldooron to the afterlife. Voldooron sees a window of a golden city and wonderful lands, where spirits welcomed him. There are lots of loxodon and Giffs (Hippofolk).

Maeve RAN to voldooron and used her crystal and revivify to try and resurrect him. She fucking revived him!

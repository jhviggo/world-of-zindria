We went through the portal from [[Stormgard]] to [[Za'le]], in Reliah's inn.
[[Reliah Lueveen]] offers us some coffee and makes some breakfast too. From talking with Reliah we realize that the dwarves that attacked [[Chariz]] probably had more information about the war than they should. Someone probably informed them to attack the city. Reliah says that [[Master Pandelume]] probably just has exhaustion and mana sickness. It's fine.
Someone knocks on the door. An individual in a fur coat and 2 swords comes in, Maeve knows who it is, his name is [[Elia]]. After him comes in [[Celia de Luinn]], Maeve's little sister. It was Celia who opened the portal that got us here. She's apparently quite strong?
She was also the one that planned his rescue and sent us in that direction.
She's in a relationship with [[Master Pandelume]]!
[[Master Pandelume]] cast a curse on himself so he could only talk to those he trusts, that way he couldn't spill any of his research or information to the [[Mages of Divinity]].
Celia will book the [[Aroma Atlas]] restaurant to celebrate that Pandelume is back.

Someone in town needs [[Nimoras Tyr Invenir aka Nim]]'s help. It's a woman from her past, [[Zithrel]].

Celia is also planning a outing with Maeve in the evening at the Plaza.
We take Pandelume upstairs and Celia removes his curse.

Dubh has been carrying around the payment from [[Zantra]] it has like 1500gold and a bunch of gems/jewels, so we each get 300gold.

We continue towards the city management to tell them about the attack on Chariz. We go towards the main hold and talk to the guards. They say Commander [[Tyroz]] is the current ruler of Za'le. The guards goes to fetch the commander and he comes back with a gray younger Tabaxi male.

We head out to find some food and we find a random fisherman who point us towards the [[Chili Cello]] and the innkeeper Willy gets us some food and beer. 
We talk about our group name and have come up with: [[The Nightshade (Player Group)]]

Nim goes to find Zinthel. She walks to Reliah's place and he says she's at the Rising Sun but she'll also be at Aroma Atlas tomorrow. Nim walks to the Rising Sun and gets to talk to Zinthel. Zinthel's mother died, and she tells Nim because Nim was like family to them.
Zinthel mother was the Minister of Treassury and her brother has another position within the treassury, and her sister too. Zinthel is the next in line to become the Minister.

The rest of us go to [[pendrals imporium]] and sell some of the stuff we found in the Kobolds cave. Pendil offers us 105 gold for it. Pendril has a bunch of magical rings for sale for like 5000 each, and a cloak for 430g, and some boots with wings for 550g.
Voldooron buys the boots.

We rest for the day and maeve goes around town listening to people around her. She hears people talking about a skyship which was docker in Za'le and some men showed up in town and disapprered quickly again, they wore red armor and there were a bunch of them.

I tried to bride the local alley cats with a stolen fish, but I failed all my rolls and they attacked me. So I ran away, lost the fish and got no information.

Maeve talks for Celia and she asks about the [[Dread Guard]] and it turns out it's an organization that sponsors the ravens, and Celia is kinda the leader of it. Celia also says that after her escape she trained endlessly, with her guardian. 

Is Celia the [[Void Empress]]? - Yes she is.

Long rest.

We wake up in the camp in the [[Wailing Caverns]] and are going to [[Chariz]].
According to [[Master Whitmoore]] some mages from [[Mages of Divinity]] decided that [[Iridium]] should be the center of magic. They are one of the strongest groups that exists. They are the ones that keep most of the magical knowledge in Iridium, so they have a huge amount of power in the city and of the politicians. But they also interfere a lot with matters outside of [[Zarephine Ca'al]].
We are going towards a camp of the mages, and there will probably be a lot of mages and maybe most of their man power will be there. Since we've encountered a lot of mercenaries from the mages, it probably means that the camp will have a lot of actual mages.

Whitmoore wants to give us some information that only the masters of the ravens know. The backers of the ravens don't have a name attached to them, so they can stay anonymous. nobility from [[Vasselheim]], [[Iridium]] and [[Sundale kingdom]]. They're sometimes known as the [[Dread Guard]]. This order is quite old and led by an empress [[Void Empress]]. Pandelume most likely used their help to find the mages camp. They probably have someone that can track down the mages and/or the camp. Whitmoore is proposing he can contact them to help us. Pandelume has cast a curse on himself, so he can't share any information about the order. Arcane magical cures so he can't tell anything. However the mages may be able to break this curse, so the sponsors are also interested in returning Pandelume.

He burns a raven feather (sign of the masters) onto the shoulder of Dubh. It's a proof that he holds certain information.

He gave Dubh a book with the sending spell.
Maeve gets a necklace for healing.
Voldooron gets a belt with mirror image.

[[Trolic]] is a guy in Chariz who has the mirror we get teleported to and he has a son [[Lorin]].

Whitmoore can teleport us to Chariz and advises us to find Pandelume and bring him back here.

* **We teleport to Chariz** by walking through the mirror portal.

We're in a tent. It looks like a large circuit tent. There's crates and barrels everywhere. Most are open and empty. we see a bugbear Musk go into the tent. He calls for [[Trolic]] who's a Leonin. As we walk out the tent there's just weapons everywhere from all different cultures and races, being given out. All the people here are probably soldiers and they're arming up as well as normal people with make-shift armor. Trolic shows us a heavy fortification outside of his tent with guards walking around. From the top of the fortification we see a large desert and a few miles away TONS of tents and fires. They have dwarven banners. They're currently under siege.
Since most of the city's soldiers are in [[Za'le]] for the war, the dwarves attacked the city.
[[Embric Boulder]] is the leader of the dwarven attack, the [[Iron Vein]] guild. They're trying to recapture the region, because many years ago most of the region was under [[Iron Vein]] rule.

Trolic does not know where the mages camp are. We could talk to [[Zantra]] "the first fang, the Blue Furry", she's the highest ranking under the Chieftain, She's in charge of the military and knows the area well. 
We'll meet with Zantra by the Night's Eye, which is an inn (tent), that still sells some beer.
As we leave we see a banner saying [[Trolic Temporal Trade]]? idk.
The town of Chariz is buzzing with activity and children running around playing, as the adults are preparing for war.
Night's Eye Inn is owned by [[Niela Pardez]] and her sisters are Mia and Thia. we go inside and it's mostly Leonin and Tabaxi.
As we sit in the inn we hear loud thunder far in the distance. This is the arcane crimson storm. Dubh has good memories of this area. He remembers seeing the cloud from the crimson storm and he remembers a tabaxi woman with black fur. He remembers being held by the edge on a cliff, looking over the desert at the storm with his mom. Finally he remembers two fangs, dripping golden blood (part of his nightmare from a Leonin or Tabaxi), before his memories fade away.

Voldooron starts playing his drum and an older Barb in the inn starts playing along. I tried to get up and dance, but I rolled a 2 and slammed my head on the table instead. But it all went well and Voldooron managed to cheer the patrons.

We see Zantra some in with a huge white mane and blue-ish fur, red eyes, wearing plated armor. She's taller than Voldooron. She comes over and chugs 2 huge pints of the ale we brought her. But she has no damn idea where the mages are. She can help us get out of the camp, by climbing down the cliffs at noon. We can maybe help some civilians get down too, so they can travel towards [[Red-Razkar]]. But that city is trying to move, because of the dwarven war.

We get some rooms to sleep in, at the inn.

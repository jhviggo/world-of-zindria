We wake up yet again at Reliah's house. He tells us that [[Zon Von Donzil]] is in town, the archeologist we wanted to talk to about the ruins. He also mentions a nice route out to some templates/towers west of town, which we could visit for fun.

We go down town for some studded leather armor for Dubh. We meet an armorer called [[Gringo]]. Dubh gets a new armor.

We go out of town towards the (Raven towers ?), we see some very chill clergymen. But we feel they keeping an eye on Dubh. We see a large statue with a Lionin archer with a hawk. 

We sit and chat. Maeve tells us about here sister. Dubh might want to ask [[Celia de Luinn]] for a job, since she works with the ravens. I might wanna ask the professor about [[Zargeth]] for some information, just in case he comes back for me and the contract.
We ask Maeve about [[Maeve's Crystal]] that she lend to [[Dilon]] to investigate and got back, and her sister said it was a [[Void Beacon]]. (Might be used for tracking her by her sister)
Nim says just kinda joined our team and was selected to help us by [[Celia de Luinn]]. But Nim also doesn't know why she was selected to help us.

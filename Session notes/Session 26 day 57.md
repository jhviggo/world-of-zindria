We tried to find [[pendrals imporium]] but got lost and found an inn instead.
There was a fight and voldooron decided to beat up the arrogant jerk fighting people.
Voldooron von easily.
The arrogant dude was a part of the [[spiker clan]] and called [[head-runner Spiraz]].

after a beer we went to [[pendrals imporium]].
It's an old wooden building and all the shelves in the store are knee-level as Pendril is a very small cat.
The helper in the store is a tiny lizard called [[Spux]]
pendril is trying to sell us a cursed kettle. There are four cursed people engraved onto it who can heat the water.
He's also showing us a magical mustache, it may give better persuasion.

Pendril has heard of a druid clan [[moon weavers]] make a magical sickle and artifacts.
They're located at the [[Meridian principality]].

He also told us of a racing area where we can find some of the [[Spikers]].
[[Spux]] lead us to the area where we could find the [[spikers]].
We scouted out the area for the race.

Then we go back to the [[Second Scabbard]] and see some leonin (lion person).
We also talk to the inkeeper about [[head-runner Spiraz]] and how we helped the other bar.

We were introduced to a young female, [[Celia de Luinn]] in the downstair shisha area.
This is [[Maeve]]'s little sister. They haven't seen each other in 1 year, but the sister looks at least 5 years older.
She holds no resentment for Maeve taking the crystal and leaving, but some people came and kidnapped the sister.
But the sister doesn't really remember much of what happened. But they took her to the Fay realm.
She were there for years in the fay realm but only months in our world.
The kidnappers wanted information from her.
After some time they brought her back to our realm and tried to execute her but she escaped.
She wandered the woodlands, shackled in simple robes.
A guardian found her and helped her get back on her feet.
Maeve's mom and dad are missing.
The guardian helps a group of people and his followers are fairly well off and have backers to help them.
Some of the guardian's followers are from multiple wealthy clans.
[[Celia de Luinn]] has minor scars around her arms and neck. Seems to be torture scars.

[[Voldooron]] asked for information about the kidnappers.
She remembers only one person, a [[sky monarch Asral]] from [[luna zilrith]] province (east of [[Sundale kingdom]]). He's most likely the person who sent the order to kidnap her.

[[Maeve's sister]] had a dream, where a shaded/hidden person gave her the crystal that Maeve carries, and she woke up actually having the crystal. [[Maeve's Crystal]].
Maeve's sister has information about [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]], he can be found east of the city in the canyon where the spiders are... [[Huntsman's Canyon]]

[[Voldooron]] is quite sad about all of this information.

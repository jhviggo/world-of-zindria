[[Master Whitmoore (dead)]] is a master of the ravens, with [[Master Pandelume (dead)]] (dubh's master).
voldooron had the idea of getting the guards attention and basically fight them to become wanted, so that whitmoore would notice a wanted poster and find us.
I suggested finding a criminal group that maybe keeps track of people going in and out of town.

to find someone we could get us selves known by the locals.
The people in the city are sometimes called the knits, because they are tightly knit community.
to start we could meet some locals in the shisha bar to get some more information.

the guide [[Zindril's father, Uldrik]] in the shisha bar has trife with clan spike (aka. spikers) or clan strider.
spikers are very particular looking. The have big ear and are thin and tall. They look quite animalistic.
spikers are running races over the rooftops (parkour!), because they believe being the dfastest makes them the best.

the striders are arrogant and just think very highly of themselves. And they have black fur like Dubh.

breakfast could be at the local [[Miguel Smoke House]] or at the [[grand aler-zar]], it's the local drinking place.
[[pendrals imporium]] is a store which sells a lot of stuff and foreign goods, such as the stuff they smoke as the shisha.
[[Madam Peacock]] is a clothing store if we want to look more like the locals.

I bought some fish for 4 copper.
I have 174g 7s 2c.

sitting there maeve listen to the people around us and the [[Ashen Kin]] are mentioned.
The [[Ashen Kin]] is another clan that the locals are surprised showed up at the city.

We saw the spikers running on the roof.
We also found [[Madam Peacock]] finally and met the owner [[Madam beguel peacock]].

I payed 30g for some new clothes. Yikes.

We talked to some locals and was told that [[Second Scabbard]] (the inn we stayed at)
is a good place to meet locals in need of help.
also Voldooron helped some guy carry a crate.

The smoking areas are called fog holes.
We went into the fog hole at the second scabbard and met [[Zindril's father, Uldrik]]
who introduces us to the people sitting down there.
We smoke some shisha and get some shimmer in it (idk what that is).
The logo on the box is from the brothers from iridium. idk who they are.

The group went to iridium, dubh delivered a message and started the [[Mages of Divinity]] crusade.
They killed a thief.

As we smoke we start have thoughts about our pasts.
Maeve saw visions of her sister that se has sent letters to.

Dubh and Voldooron go over to talk to [[Pendril Paleric]] and the group (the guys in the fog hole).

the elf sitting in the group is [[Reliah Lueveen]], who seems interested in Maeve.
We bought a map from [[Pendril Paleric]] which his brother got from some Professor from Vasselheim.
The professors name is [[Zon Von Donzil]]. He's a archeologist interested in old deities and part of the [[Arkivian Archives]] from vasselheim. He's trying to become a Quill Master.

The elf [[Reliah Lueveen]] might have more information we need.

we went to bed.

We went to [[Miguel Smoke House]] again because it was good.
Voldooron bougt a jar of sauce and [[Dubh]] and [[Voldooron]] tried it and had to roll for constitution.

In the map [[region of Za'lune]] just north-east of [[Za'le]] is [[Luq'zaar Canyons, the huntsmens domain]].
That's where we went through going to [[Za'el]] when I rolled a 28 and basically skipped the area.

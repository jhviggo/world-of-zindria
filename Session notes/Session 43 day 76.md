We wake up yet again at Reliah's house. He tells us that [[Zon Von Donzil]] is in town, the archeologist we wanted to talk to about the ruins. He also mentions a nice route out to some templates west of town, which we could visit for fun.

We go down town for some studded leather armor for Dubh. We meet an armorer called [[Gringo]].

We wake up yet again at Reliah's house. He tells us that [[Zon Von Donzil]] is in town, the archeologist we wanted to talk to about the ruins. He also mentions a nice route out to some templates/towers west of town, which we could visit for fun.

We go down town for some studded leather armor for Dubh. We meet an armorer called [[Gringo]]. Dubh gets a new armor.

We go out of town towards the (Raven towers ?), we see some very chill clergymen. But we feel they keeping an eye on Dubh. We see a large statue with a Lionin archer with a hawk.

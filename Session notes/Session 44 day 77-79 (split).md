We wake up in [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]]'s lair and see [[Marcus meridius]], [[Reliah Lueveen]] and some more people. They don't seem surprised to see us and have probably been waiting for people to show up. Reliah is not wearing his normal formal attire, but instead armor. Marcus is wearing a black robe like when we saw him in the cave. The last unknown guy is a dreadguard and has armor and a crossbow.
We also see [[Zim]] dead on the floor.

As we start to fight, Reliah leaves and we fight the dreadguard and Marcus. Dubh fears them and they leave.
We start running out of the cave and Dubh gets downed alt I almost die. But we survived and set up camp. Dubh sends a message to Voldooron and he's flying upside down with his magic boots. Then in the night 2 huntsmen come to the cave entrance. One of them is [[Crox]] who was the one who guided us here in the first place.
We go back to their camp and eat some scorpion jerky.
We take a short rest and get back up. We wake up and are told we can get escorted to the bigger camp, that we rested at a while ago.
We talk to Crox and the other one, they escorted Marcus, Reliah and he guard to the cave but Marcus was the one who killed his girlfriend.
We go towards the main [[Ashen Kin]] camp but we're not welcome. We ask Crox to guide us  to [[Za'le]] and he agrees to take us through a dangerous but faster path. Dubh is still struggling with the images of his master's death and death of the Ravens. 
A big raven with a blue magic sigil lands by us as we set camp. It has a message for us, we accept and a little scroll appears for Dubh. It's a message from the [[Forsaken Ravens]] from [[Master Pandelume (dead)]]. see [[A fond farefell.pdf]]
We accept the offer in the letter to get help. So the raven leads us towards Za'le, but we set up camp and tell the Bird to wait, so we don't get more exhaustion. At dawn we continue following the bird and we're getting close to Za'le. We can still see the [[Mages of Divinity]] skyship. 
We manage to get into the city and the people don't seem to react to the Raven as if it's invisible. 
The bird leads us through the city and we hear people gossip about the trouble that happened at [[Aroma Atlas]]. We see some [[Nuani Hunters]] at the entrance of Aroma Atlas. The raven leads us to a smaller back alley and a side door start to glow like the raven. There's a door with a black void behind it. Dubh opens it and look, we talk about if we should go in, but we get sucked into the void and suddenly stand in a bright room. There's a little island plato with an alter and a small fountain, creek and bridge. But the island is not in the water, it is in the [[Ethereal Sea]] it's in the nothingness of the galaxy, a place called [[Fortunes Favor]].
There's a building on this island and there are signs of people having been here not long ago. We go into the building and see a statue. There's also a shadowing blurred-out creature inside, multiple show up. There are in total 5 blurred-out creatures, and they all seem to be staring at us. One of them step towards us and we notice a huge Scythe on his back. It's [[Sarah Bruz]], someone the players met previously. She leads us to [[Nieta]] to explain what's going on. They're a group called the [[Palensia Pioneers]]. We can join them if we complete a small test. If we join we'll have our memories purged but we'll have protection from the mages. She sends out a letter to Maeve, Voldooron and Nim, but Nim can't be reached.
We get escorted to a house, which if we complete the mission, will be ours.

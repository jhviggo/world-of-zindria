We start off having been kicked out of the library, standing in the hallway.
We leave the [[Arkivian Archives]] and we see the people talking, a younger person with white hair and glasses, and a moon/crescent shaped mantel similar to [[Master Vorkas Lightheart]]'s but not identical, and another person is a diplomat in colorful/golden robes and ceremonial armor, and next to him a mage of [[Mages of Divinity]] guarding the diplomat. The white-haired person left as he was uncomfortable with the conversation and as the mage and diplomat look over at us he takes the opportunity to leave. The diplomat and mage are looking at us.
We try to just walk by them, but as we get near the diplomat ask to speak with us. He want to apologize on behalf of the [[Mages of Divinity]] as [[Master Vorkas Lightheart]] took his task too serious and they murdered everybody. His message seems scripted so he's probably just a messenger, he doesn't care about us. The diplomat was here to walk to Vorkas' younger brother at the archives. The diplomat's name is [[Ambrel]] he has a room in the [[Silverfall Rest Inn]].
We start heading off to the center of town we walked past on the way to the archives, we walk path the obsidian ward, which is mostly houses and residential areas. We cross a bridge and get to an industrial-ish area, they're mostly workshops and production, not really store fronts. We ask a guard and he mentions the [[Hilton Inn]] which we can also stay at, but Silverfall is more popular. 
We go into a jeweler and buy 3 diamonds. Afterwards we go to the Silverfall Inn and see a bunch of nicely dressed goblins. Dubh asks about [[Crackenguard]] as he has to go there eventually.
We go into the bar in the inn and there's a bunch of merchants chatting. Voldooron starts playing his drum and rolls a 26 god damn. We chill and take a long rest.
In the morning we get up and head to the archives to [[Prof. Tiffen abbermon]]'s office. We get ready for a ritual to draw out [[Raz'ir]] from Dubh and we all get in the circle so we can help and see his memories.

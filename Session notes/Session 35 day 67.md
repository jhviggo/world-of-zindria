We wake up in the rooms in [[Chariz]].
Dubh had a nightmare and has decided to become a night walker. he woke up half naked and wet in the middle of the beer tent. His moustache is suspiciously dry.
We can see burned claw marks on the wooden pillars in the tent and talon footsteps on the roof.
dubh goes back to his room to get changed and read his spell book.

We asked to buy some diamonds and we could either go to [[Trolic Temporal Trade]] or the [[Wandering Anvil]]. We start with the Anvil. We see a small cat creature, similar to Pendral from Za'le. His name is [[Timolt Smoulder]]. Voldooron offers to help the blacksmith for a discount on the diamonds, since we have a few hours before we escape the city at noon. He agrees and voldooron gets an apron with a mustached cat sigil.
While he's working Maeve, Nim and I go to Trolic's to look for more diamonds. Maeve tries to get 2 diamonds for 350g xD That didn't work as they normally cost 30 each. We buy one diamond at trolics and go back to the Anvil to buy another. He says he has some task for us he wants to talk about later or maybe tomorrow, but we're probably leaving soon, sooo.

We go back to the nights eye inn and meet Dubh. We then head off to meet with [[Zantra]] about the escape plan. We enter the main city hall and there are tons of soldiers. We go upstairs and find Zantra reading a scroll. She takes us up to a tower and have voldooron look through a spyglass at the dwarven camp. They don't have any walls of defences around their camp, just tons of siege artillery. They probably have a lot of engineers in the camp. There are also cannons but we don't know what those are.
We plan to make a slide and an elevator behind the city to evacuate the citizen. We also want to hold a fake festival to cover our construction. Then when we plan to evacuate in 3 days the army will attack the dwarves to make sure we can escape without being attacked.
We appoint Dubh as the leader to organize the plan.
Zantra mentioned a legend of a black Tabaxi clan called [[Sons of Raz'ir]], that used to help the city. But people didn't like them. She'll meet us at the Nights Eye at afternoon with some people that can help us. She sent a guy called Sahns to talk to Smoulder, get materials and the history book about Son's of Raz'ir.
Voldooron goes off to help Smoulder in the blacksmith to get some engineers and the rest of us go to the construction site. We talk about making some slides using wildshape as spiders and using spider silk and webs. I can also use conjure animals to help construction.
Construction begins!
I transform into a spider and carry one of the engineers down the cliff to inspect the ledges. My spider form is now named Carl.
Engineers are called [[Grun]] and [[Rebrik]]

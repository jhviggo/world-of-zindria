We start off by Azuth leading the group into the forest over a small bridge into the Ashbalt forest. I also know that this region is the original region of the [[Grass Blades Order]] where they started. I presume that [[Illiana Hawkside]] resides in the main hub. On the way however we go past my old home.
As we walk into the forest we see houses and smaller towers, which indicates that it used have people living here.

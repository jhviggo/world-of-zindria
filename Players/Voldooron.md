### when he died
Voldooron died to the spiders. Right after we see a golden creature we have never seen before, two Spinx come leading Voldooron to the afterlife. Voldooron sees a window of a golden city and wonderful lands, where spirits welcomed him. There are lots of loxodon and Giffs (Hippofolk) guards. They asked him to join them in the afterlife, but Voldooron heard Maeve's voice in the distance. He completely ignored the guards and focused on Maeve's voice.

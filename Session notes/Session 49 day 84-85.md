We start off by Azuth leading the group into the forest over a small bridge into the Ashbalt forest. I also know that this region is the original region of the [[Grass Blades Order]] where they started. I presume that [[Illiana Hawkside]] resides in the main hub. On the way, we will go past my old home where Azuth grew up.
As we walk into the forest we see houses and smaller towers, which indicates that it used have people living here.

As we walk through the swamp we get attack by little water critters [[Vortapede]]. I tried to dissect one for poison, but I made a mess and got nothing.

We press on, and as we get further, one side of the forest is swampy but the other side is dense beautiful forest. The air in the dense forest is much fresher than the swamp-air, but there's a magical presence in the air. There's a shift in the creatures and nature around us, as there's no more marshlands/swamp. There are no smaller/young trees, only the large old trees, who's crowns cover the sky.  As we set up camp, Ez find a small statue with some old Elvish writing on it. It's just a little warding shrine with a blessing written on it.
Azuth knows that these were the ancient ways of the [[Grass Blades Order]] to ward their land, as sort of a boundry of hubs where they could spread their influence. But now they're just reminders of a time long gone.
We talk about bargaining with the order or [[Zargeth]] and I know that [[Illiana Hawkside]] is more reasonable than the others, but she's still a high-ranking officer.
[[lukumoreh]] contacts me suddenly. I allow him to contact me. He has stored a vessel in me and he wants to talk. Shhadows antlers and skulls appear from me and an shadowy shape emerge from me. It says that many other spirits have been killed by Zargeth, just like I almost killed [[lukumoreh]]. It showes us the forms of the other gods and how they're dying and being strangled. There are 10-15 other gods that have been either killed or taken over. He says that the spirits of old are not meant for this much control/power, Zargeth is not supposed to break the balance like this. He says that we cannot kill Zargeth, he shows us a vision of a huge old tree. We cannot kill him because he'll be reincarnated after many years, and hopefully he'll be reincarnated with less lust to kill others. Lukumoreh believe that it's the generals and the order that partly corrupts him.
"An ugly flower can be removed and the roots let stay, and it'll grow back pretty".

We go to bed.
The day after we make it to a small town, which I used to go to to resupply. It's very cozy and the houses are built around the trees and around. We go into the town. There are a few people who spot us and move into their houses, and a few of them stay in the center with weapons. village of [[Ishal]] the village Elder comes out to greet us.
I ask about why Zargeth is expanding but he doens't know muc. He felt the hold of the old oak weaken over the years, his influence has been strengthened elsewhere.
I also ask about my mother and he gets a conflicted facial expression. He looks over to my friends and ask if I trust them. I say yes.
He helped my father with having my mother escape. The village was very fond of her. They don't know where she ended up. He doesn't know why she had to escape. He says that [[Illiana Hawkside]] went to my old home many times looking for something. but they failed every time. he suspects it was my father's armor [[Coat of Emberlin]].

We bid the village farewell and continue towards by old home. There's the out-house, garden house, training area and pond I used to jump in. The inside of the house if broken down and the place is ransacked. Everything has been turned upside down. It's very homey with name carvings on the chairs and trinkets hanging around. I walk into the inner part and it's a bit overgrown and moss covers the ground and tree. Windows are broken and floorboards have been broken open. As I enter fireflys follow me and surround me. I reach my hand out and one of them land on me, as I get a vision of my dad holding my mother with my in her arms. Then I see an argument where she yells and throws a chair on the floor. Another firefly lands on me and I see my mom sitting in the outside chair with my dad standing in his armor and a flag and guards around him and a ham I've never seen before. The man is tall nobel looking with a huge spear with a cresent star. he gives my dad a set of armor and bows.
A third vision I see my dad in conflict of his loyalty, but he confuses on the love for his family. he looks at my mom and starts packing things. I was there looking, and I should have rememberede it but I don't.
The next vision I see us all rushing through the trees and the nobel man opening a hole in the ground under a boulder and let me and my mother in. My father shape-changes and has his armor set still visible.
next firefly I see my dad and I training and shape-shifting. I see a ritual with the grass blades surrounding me and I get placed in a pool with black water and roots. They pierce my skin and I scream, my dad looks concerned. I don't remember any of this.
Visions of me being tested, tortured, trained and me going through rituals and all sorts of horrible things, but I only remember the fun training with my dad, none of all of this bad stuff.
more visions of another trial where my dad argues, it's an alter, but my father holds me back and stops me from taking the trial.
The next memory is of [[Illiana Hawkside]] giving me an amulet of [[Zargeth]]. After this is the first thing I remember from my life.

I tell the others about my visions. Dubh rolls and it seems that my trials and tests were preparing me for something. Like they were preparing me for something.
I go up and touch the armor, it looks like leather but it's as tough as steel. It's acid green with golden sigils and overlapping scale armor. Medium armor +3 AC in wildshape, and twice per long rest I can cast a spell in wildshape that does not need consentration.
A letter falls out with a sigil of Moon City in [[Zarephine Ca'al]]. it's from my mother saying she's safe and sound, and miss my father and I.

I tell the others about how my mother and I walked to Mudwip and found my father strung up, but it was a false memory. It was really [[Illiana Hawkside]] that took me to see my dad's corpse.
Suddenly we all hear a voice behinds us and it's the nobel man. he tells me to come outside. He calls me the promised/chosen one and says I failed my mission. That my father was a more nobel man. he says that it was him who sent me out on the suicide mission to kill [[lukumoreh]].
A vine-copy of one of the [[moon weavers]] members [[Detric Ironbark]] forms and he beheads it.
[[Thalenor Brightclave]] aka The Midnight Spear, Eldest member of the Grass blades.
We assume that Detric might actually be dead, since [[Messina Moonglade]] hasn't heard from the Moon Weavers. 
[[Zemberlen Seat]] is the next area where we can find [[Illiana Hawkside]].

We ask Messina about her fighting style. She hasn't had any official training like a school. A pack was made which she's no longer following, so she's repaying for it, which affects the way she fights.

We continue towards [[Ishal Hamlet]], the bigger city where's well now find [[Illiana Hawkside]] in the main hall. We know that the elves have already spotted us and are following us, but they're not intervening with us since [[Thalenor Brightclave]] wants to fight us and give it our best try.
So we set camp outside the city waiting for daylight.

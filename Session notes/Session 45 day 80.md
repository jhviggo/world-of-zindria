We wake up in the house and talk about what happened. Maeve found a bunch of papers in [[Marcus meridius]]'s house that showed that they were ordering tools and a bunch of stuff for making the screaming liquid. She also found a bottle of the screaming liquid that we found a long time ago in the box in the broken cart.
I go study the papers, Dubh looks into the book he found in [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]]'s cave. There's not much arcane in there, mostly information about Whitmoore's time with the ravens. It talks about [[Moon City]] which is in [[Hainge]] island in [[Zarephine Ca'al]]. Dubh also knows that [[House Lion Heart]] runs the city, because they discovered a Rift/labyrinth and got rich. The mages were smuggling books and knowledge out or [[Iridium]] and it went through Moon City, but they didn't move all of it out of the city so there may be a lot of knowledge stored away in that town. [[Valiant Embers]] is the guild responsible for moving much of this knowledge. There a 6 known rifts/labyrinths, which are being plundered from.
The ingredients in the screaming liquid are very forbidden. It's a combination of alchemy and soul craft. That also makes sense in the way his teleportation works, as he switches place with a person. He has to sacrifice souls for his potions.
Maeve is looking at her stone, as again is seeing the starry sky with a cloudy shadow in it. She figured that the shadow is a anti-scrying spell.

As Dubh goes to bed he hears an excited snarling. It's the sound of the demon he made a pact with. The voices says "they'll take over for this one" and Voldooron hears steps going down the stairs. he sneaks to the door and hides, he sees Dubh walking towards the main entrance. It seems like there are two bodies on one on Dubh, as if something is holding him up, puppeteering him. As he walks, it appears and disappears from Dubh's body. His teeth are dripping golden blood, and the shadow creature is 20cm taller than Dubh. It is [[R]]
Dubh goes through the portal and Voldooron calls out to us. We all run through down and through the portal.
We see Dubh attack the god [[Vander]] but all his attacks just phase through his body. All the other people take up their weapons, but Vander waves them off. Vander absolutely smacks Dubh.

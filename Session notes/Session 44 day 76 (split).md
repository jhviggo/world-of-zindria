We wake up in [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]]'s lair and see [[Marcus meridius]], [[Reliah Lueveen]] and some more people. They don't seem surprised to see us and have probably been waiting for people to show up. Reliah is not wearing his normal formal attire, but instead armor. Marcus is wearing a black robe like when we saw him in the cave. The last unknown guy is a dreadguard and has armor and a crossbow.
We also see [[Zim]] dead on the floor.

As we start to fight, Reliah leaves and we fight the dreadguard and Marcus. Dubh fears them and they leave.

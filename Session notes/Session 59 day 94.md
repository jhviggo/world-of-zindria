We start off having been kicked out of the library, standing in the hallway.
We leave the [[Arkivian Archives]] and we see the people talking, a younger person with white hair and glasses, and a moon/crescent shaped mantel similar to [[Master Vorkas Lightheart]]'s but not identical, and another person is a diplomat in colorful/golden robes and ceremonial armor, and next to him a mage of [[Mages of Divinity]] guarding the diplomat. The white-haired person left as he was uncomfortable with the conversation and as the mage and diplomat look over at us he takes the opportunity to leave. The diplomat and mage are looking at us.
We try to just walk by them, but as we get near the diplomat ask to speak with us. He want to apologize on behalf of the [[Mages of Divinity]] as [[Master Vorkas Lightheart]] took his task too serious and they murdered everybody. His message seems scripted so he's probably just a messenger, he doesn't care about us. The diplomat was here to walk to Vorkas' younger brother at the archives.

# day 44
We're taking the caravan called [[The Apothecary]].
We'll be joined by a few other adventures and lead by [[John Riley]].
He wears a patch-jacket and a top hat, has long black beard and a big red nose.
He also wears overalls and a vest.
He's a potion seller.

one of our companion is a crypt doctor, she researches death and decise ([[Reiley Ripert]])
other is a halfling ([[Pinolapi Hardner]])
and last is some guy ([[Vesko Mourn]])
tabaksi woman ([[Tea pawmy]])

I befriended Riley and she showed disected undead parts in front of me.
I also BOUGHT a potion of undead repellent.

I inspected [[Maeve's Crystal]] and found something interesting.
Stars and skies swirling in fluid motion with a vail around it.

[[Mages of Divinity]] landed an air-ship further ahead of our caravan, unloading things.
They have set up a camp/checkpoint and are checking caravans going through.
We all hide in the shelves and stuff in the caravan.
We made it through the camp with Maeve's charm!! Wohoo

[[Master Pandelume]] was dubh's master and we're trying to find and save him (dubh's mission)
Voldooron was bought as a slave and treated like shit. His body is covered in scars.

crypt doctor [[Reiley Ripert]] is part of the [[Circle of Zealots]].

We left the caravan and went into the wilderness.
We spot a Cart with a hidding chest.
The chest had a vial of fluid.
The fluid is kinda living and I used speak to animal to hear a thousand screams.
[[Screaming Fluid]].

The letters mentioned something we heard rumors about in Egelia about gang troubles
about shipments for the [[Elwendia Marketeers]].

We also found 450g in the box.

# went into the desert/plains
set up camp and was ambushed by hyenas in the night.
I talked to one of them and it said it was waiting for its leader.
we killed most of the gnolls and hyenas.

I failed a const save and am exhausted.
exhaustion i get disadvantage on ability checks until I remove the exhaustion with a spend rest die.
I made it through my exhaustion and am feeling fine for the second day.

we made it to a canyon and are walking through it.
We can see a wooden pole on the side with a red banner hanging on it.

lolol I rolled a 28 and we arrive days earlier than expected and we skipped [[Huntsman's Canyon]] full of spiders.
So we made it to a crossroad with white sandstone building and a lot of tents.
This leads to [[Za'le]] where tons of people enter and leave the city as we arrive.
At [[Za'le]] there's the end of the large river and we see large ships.
All the tents are from different clans gathering and there are more than there usually would be.

We walk into town and see a lot of stands selling mounts, armor, weaponry and things for the war effort.

There are huge sails and banners above the city showing the insignia of the ruling clan.
The ruling clan is "[[Light Mane]]".

There an inn called Rising Sun.
The guards question us.
The guards would get payed to give information about a master of mages.
The guard got tired of us and sent anoter guard to give information to the mages of divinity.
We left.

We did not go to the Rising Sun Inn because the guards are kinda looking for us.
We went to another smaller inn called the [[Second Scabbard]].

we're getting 2 rooms at the inn for 3 nights.
The barmaid is called [[zindril]].
We get some beer and grilled fish.

We're looking for [[Master Whitmoore]] (who's wanted by the [[Mages of Divinity]]) in [[Za'le]]

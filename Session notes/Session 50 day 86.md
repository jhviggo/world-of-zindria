We get up and walk into [[Ishal Hamlet]] where we'll find [[Illiana Hawkside]]. We walk down the main street/path and the elves around us are looking at us and know what's about to happen and they're whispering amongst themselves. They keep saying [[Zuth]] referring to Azuth, meaning "Bad blood", which is the name given to people who fail the ritual. We go up into the main tower and find a guestbook with some names in it [[Luna Longleaf]], [[Thalenor Brightclave]],
We go to the top of the tower and find [[Illiana Hawkside]]. She says she not sure which part she want's to play in all of this. She says I was part of a fortune or an omen of [[Zargeth]]. She talks about my father, that his interference cause  trouble. Illiana suggested that the order replaced him because they needed me to me more subjugated. She wanted to tell me about my family's fate and what they fight for, both she says I failed them. The old Oak gave and [[Omen of Sunder]] and Illiana says they're trying to unite the druid circles to prevent the Sunder, but because Druid circles are old and stubborn they decide to take the circles by force. The elves around us are part of the [[Emberlin Guard]]. [[Luna Longleaf]] shows up.

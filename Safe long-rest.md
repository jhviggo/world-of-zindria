To be able to take a Greater-Short rest the party must be in a “safe” environment. The story behinds this is that if the party is in need for a “Guard-rotation” means that the place is not safe. This “can” include towns if there are creatures who are ACTIVELY hunting you. Here you can choose to still take a long rest but thereby taking the chance the hunters find you. It would be wise to maybe amount some sort of defense to allow you to do a long rest.

Greater-Short rests take the usage of **Rest Dices** which can be used as seen below:
- A player can spend any amount of their Rest Dices to regain Hit points just as short rests, **plus your CON modifier**
- A player can spend any amount of **Rest Dices** to roll, the rolled amount is the amount of spell slots to regain (**Add spell-casting modifier to the roll**). The regained spell slots can be distributed as wished amongst all levels.
- A player can spend any amount of **Rest Dices** to roll, Add spell-casting modifier to the roll and then times it with your spell level. The final amount is the number of spell points you can regain.

The amount of Rest dices you can spend on a Greater-Short rest is determined as follow: You spend any amount of your hit-dices to roll a number of d4’s which is determined by your current level. The rolled number is how many “Rest Dices” you have for that greater-short rest. The rest dices themselves are your hit dices.
- level 1 – 5 : 1d4
- level 6 – 10: 2d4
- level 11 – 13: 2d6
- level 14 – 20: 2d8

We start our session in the city of [[Crossguard]] and head to the [[Arkivian Archives]] to find [[Prof. Tiffen abbermon]] for Dubh to get some information on [[Master Pandelume (dead)]] before he forgets. Ez rolls perception to see if anybody it following us or keeping an eye on us. She notices that some people on a balcony in a fancy house is looking down at us, it's a human male with white hood and sigils on the shoulders and golden eyes. He notices that she's looking. Maeve recognizes him as a part of [[Mages of Divinity]]. We enter the archives and meet up with [[Juella Spore]] as we have the tokens she gave us so we could enter.

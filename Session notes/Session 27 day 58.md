[[Maeve Luin]] and her sister went out for their spa day. And meanwhile I got lost in the city. [[Reliah Lueveen]] came to find me and the others, to take us out to lunch with [[Maeve Luin]]. He knows the city very well and takes shortcuts and get greeted by the locals.
We were lead to the [[Aroma Atlas]] restaurant (the tallest building in the city).
There is a Loxodon whos the main chef, [[Sir Beroldus, the spice king]].
We get a huge meal with tons of meats and especially Garloc, a huge boar.

I ate some of the super spicy soup and rolles a const save, but I passed.
we went up to the bar above the restaurant.
I got a beer from [[Vasselheim]]'s capital [[Folks Heaven]].

From the window we can see an airship dock at one of the other tall towers, as it's a skyport. It has dark blue sails with silver lining and a large crest in the center. It's a wooden shield and a blue bird icon with a long neck, kinda peacock looking. There's this large sigil on each side of  the hull.

I rolled a fucken nat 1 trying to history check the ship xD

[[Maeve Luin]] has seen the banner before in [[Iridium]] from one of the Houses of Celion and more specifically House Sherwood. This house might have competed with the Richmonds as far as Dubh remembers. 

We return to the [[Second Scabbard]] and go to sleep.

## Day of the race
We get up early to prepare for the race. It turns out that we have to reach the flag and back to the starting point. (lelel Jannik realized he made the map too short).
The [[Spikers]] agreed to not have anymore races if we win, however we have to pay them a lot if they win.

At the racing area (inner city) Dubh got a cloak that [[Spux]] used as a napping blanket. [[Voldooron]] ripped it to make it a little more useful while running and Spux got sad! 

I called down some Crows from the sky and persuaded them to attack the main enemy runner xD And it worked!

We won the race easily!

[[Zindril's father, Uldrik]] offers us some free beer and smokes at the [[Second Scabbard]].

Afterwards we tried finding the cafe Maeve went to with her sister, but we got lost.
Instead we ended up at the skyport. By the skyport we see a guard with brown hair and a large futcoat following [[Celia de Luinn]] out of the city with another woman we have never seen before. She very unique looking with purple hair, long elven ears, and a massive black scar accross her race covering here eye. She has a silver shoulder piece on and a long dress. She's having a serious conversation with [[Celia de Luinn]]. 
Maeve managed to read their lips and they're talking about a successful mission and why that person came there to talk about it. So probably the two people completed a task for [[Celia de Luinn]] and she was wondering why they didn't just send a letter instead of showing up in person.

We then head of to [[Miguel Smoke House]] to get some food.

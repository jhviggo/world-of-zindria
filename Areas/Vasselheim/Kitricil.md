Capitol of Kitricil is divided into 4 smaller islands within the fogmount sea. You have not directly been there because your dad kept you around the hamlet. Also the wood elves of ashbalt forest live in a cashless society meaning you are more working for the communal services and food shared by all.
The four islands are:
* **Isle of Naldesha (Elvish for Falcon's head)** The common folk isle, the majority of wood elves of the Ashbalt forest kinda live here 
* **Isle of Cilintra (Elvish for Communal comfort)** The city center of sorts, where markets, shops and activities play out 
* **Isle of Lyzilia (Elvish for High ruling)** The ruling isle that houses the mansions home to the higher members of the grassblades such as Enshanti blades 
* **Isle of Lyvia (Elvish for isle of marble)** Where the palace sits together with major shrines and temples

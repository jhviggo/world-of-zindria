### She was kidnapped
She remembers only one person, a [[sky monarch Asral]] from [[luna zilrith]] province (east of [[Sundale kingdom]]). He's most likely the person who sent the order to kidnap her.

# Her past
Maeve asks why the sky monarch sent someone to their house. Maeve's family heritage is part of a blood line that the monarchs fear, the Blood or black Butcher? Her grandfather, and the empire feared him.

We ask Maeve about what Wander said. Maeve says it's her fault we're in the situation we're in with Celia. An order came to her house but she ran away, and then came back for Celia but she was taken. It was the Knights of Purity in the Order of Purification that came for them. They hunt people who have certain kinds of magic or views that don't align with the country.

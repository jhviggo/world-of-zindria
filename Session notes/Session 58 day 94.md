We start our session in the city of [[Crossguard]] and head to the [[Arkivian Archives]] to find [[Prof. Tiffen abbermon]] for Dubh to get some information on [[Master Pandelume (dead)]] before he forgets. Ez rolls perception to see if anybody it following us or keeping an eye on us. She notices that some people on a balcony in a fancy house is looking down at us, it's a human male with white hood and sigils on the shoulders and golden eyes. He notices that she's looking. Maeve recognizes him as a part of [[Mages of Divinity]]. We enter the archives and meet up with [[Juella Spore]] as we have the tokens she gave us so we could enter. Wee see a plaque with names of the current [[Quill Masters]] and see some names we recognize, like the professors of the archive and [[Scarlett Willbloom]] a lightheart, probably a family member of [[Master Vorkas Lightheart]].  Scarlet comes to pick us up in the archive lobby, she's a friend of Juella and a professor at the archives. [[Professor Brian Markif]] focuses on arcane blockage and [[Professor Hornwill]] focuses on dark elven history, whereas Scarlett researches in spiritual arcana. Ez asks about paladin orders and Scarlett informs us that [[Alemont Deffor]] might know something.
Scarlett takes us to see [[Prof. Tiffen abbermon]] and he's just finishing up a lecture and agrees to talk to us.
I got a book on "Current political affairs of Vasselheim" after walking to the currator [[Pimpel Stamp]] an undead imp who had run the library for hundreds of years.

Vasselheim is a republic. There's a central seat of chansellors with the voting power over the nation. called the baronial assembly with 160 delegates which can vote. 140 of them are dedicated to the barons and the rest are the chansellors and nobilities. Sometimes the bannerlords will also be called in to vote with 100 deligations and the emporer also has 100 votes. one of the barons is called [[Allistar Whitmoore]] probably in family with [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]].
This system stems from the disconnection of the previous lord of Vasselheim, so one person didn't have the power. He could no longer lead properly so he created the baronies. under the barons are the chansellors and then the lords.

After reading the books we were thrown out of the library because it was closing down for the day. The door is fading away leaving us with a dead end hallway.

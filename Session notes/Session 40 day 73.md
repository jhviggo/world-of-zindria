We continue through the desert towards Dubh's ping. The storms have passed and a lot of the smaller plants have disappeared. We see burrows and marks of animals around and spot a little blue large dog-sized creature with horns on its shoulders with white sigils on it.
I approach it. It has a little snout but it kinda looks like a hyena. It has crystals on its skin going up the legs.
I pet it :3
It bit my fingers and I got blessing of Eve: **+1 to spell modifiers** until long rest.
We went into a cave for rest and found a Boulder Brute monster.

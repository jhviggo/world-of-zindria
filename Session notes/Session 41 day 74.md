We continue walking towards Dubh's ping and we're getting closer to [[Master Pandelume (dead)]] we should reach him by the end of the day.
We approach a cave system with wooden palicades in front of it. Dubn and I use Pass without a Trace and walk up to the fortification. We see a person patrolling ~120 feet away. As we get closer Dubh casts invis.
This place is called [[Stormgard]]
Ruru sees that 4 entrances to the cave system and one of them is a small plumming-sized funnel seemingly leading into the mountain. Ruru disappeared as she got closer.
I jump-scared Voldooron and he slapped me xD I took 7dmg.
We rest up an go close to the pallisades and Dubh climbes up and tries to assassinate a sleeping guard at the top. Dubh missed and almost woke the guard xD -> Red-conned he placed the hook instead of attack. He missed again xD!!!
Dubh just walked up to some of the guards and they immediately ran and alerted all the other guards... A Guardian of Divine showed up (The big robot thing that we met when we fought Victor).
A guy showed up [[Master Vorkas Lightheart]] one of the 3 masters of the [[Mages of Divinity]].
We're getting slapped.
We managed to save [[Master Pandelume (dead)]] and someone somewhere cast a void portal which took us to [[Za'le]] in the Inn where we see [[Reliah Lueveen]] in his morning robe.
We don't know who cast the portal or what it was.

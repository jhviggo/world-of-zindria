We wake up in the inn and downstairs we see the owner [[Marcia Bellhaven]] and a larger bard, with a rapier and an instrument, talking. The owner suggests we meet [[Sully Oliviara]], the bard, to help us to [[Crossguard]]. He offers to drive us in his caravan with his wife [[Brit Oliviara]], who's a strong fighter.
We go out to the caravan area and see a very large gate in the city wall, where the caravans can enter through.

The caravan, the [[Guilded Colossus]], is pulled by large Rhino-looking creatures.
Inside the caravan we meet the wife, a green-skinned half-orc cooking dinner. By her side there's a battle axe. We ask Brit about the war that [[Gri'more Empire]] is involved in and [[Vasselheim]] is holding back on supporting a side in the war. However, there was a battle at one of the castles in Gri'more and some other rumors about the king [[Young Griffon]].
In the caravan Sully goes to practice his music and we all go listen. He uses magic to control magical strings embedded in the wood all around the caravan. Dubh compliments his use of magic and Voldooron compliments the music.
Sully analyses voldoorons music of being too joyful because of his rough past, trying to hide his scars and war past.
"Due to my Passive Insight, I notice Voldooron getting uncomfortable when Sully did his analysis of Voldoorons choice of musical act."
We had a drinking contest and the winners were
1. voldooron
2. Azuth
3. Brit
I cheated a little by using enhance ability. Ez spies on Brit working out, creepy.

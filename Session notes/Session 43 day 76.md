We wake up yet again at Reliah's house. He tells us that [[Zon Von Donzil]] is in town, the archeologist we wanted to talk to about the ruins. He also mentions a nice route out to some templates/towers west of town, which we could visit for fun.

We go down town for some studded leather armor for Dubh. We meet an armorer called [[Gringo]]. Dubh gets a new armor.

We go out of town towards the (Raven towers ?), we see some very chill clergymen. But we feel they keeping an eye on Dubh. We see a large statue with a Lionin archer with a hawk. 

We sit and chat. Maeve tells us about here sister. Dubh might want to ask [[Celia de Luinn]] for a job, since she works with the ravens. I might wanna ask the professor about [[Zargeth]] for some information, just in case he comes back for me and the contract.
We ask Maeve about [[Maeve's Crystal]] that she lend to [[Dilon]] to investigate and got back, and her sister said it was a [[Void Beacon]]. (Might be used for tracking her by her sister)
Nim says just kinda joined our team and was selected to help us by [[Celia de Luinn]]. But Nim also doesn't know why she was selected to help us.

We go back and sleep.
In the morning Reliah leaves early and has set breakfast. As we're eating [[Master Pandelume (dead)]] comes down the stairs. He fixes stuff in Dubh's spell book. He also says he knew that the letter he had Dubh deliver was gonna stir up trouble. Pandelume mentions that Nim wears clothes of the institution of a college and is a student.

Dubh and Pandelume go away to talk. He tells Dubh that he had been dealing with the [[Mages of Divinity]] and the letter he sent was because of his research and as a favor to the [[Dread Guard]]. He's researching the storms in the [[Crimson Savannah]] to try and harness them. He's also looking into where they come from and why they are there. There are very little history of them, indicating that they didn't always used to be there, they're kinda new. The have a connection with the powers that keep [[Zarephine Ca'al]] floating, but that magic is decaying and fading away. The magic keeping the islands up are being lifted by winds over to the savannah, causing the storms. This discovery shows that the great nation of Zeraphine is falling apart, literally. And the Mages of Divinity doesn't like that being spread into the news.
Iridium Ca'al is one of the deity decaying with the cover in Zarephine, but there's also another deity, but Pandelume doesn't know which.
Dubh tells Pandelume about the nightmare in Chariz, where he woke up in the inn. Pandelume knows something, but he doesn't want to tell Dubh yet. Pandelume gets very mad when he realizes Dubh made a pact with the nightmare. He's very mad.
Dubh's magic crossbow is not arcane magic, is druidic.

I look at Dubh's bow and there's a crystal in the middle which used to have spirits in it. Maeve also looks at it and she notices that the crystal has to be replaced, it can't be refilled. It's just a normal crystal/spiritual stone that a lot of Druids can make.

We go to the party in the evening for saving Pandelume. There are so many people we know and a bunch we don't.
[[Master Pandelume (dead)]], [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]], [[Mirilla cyran Reymire]], [[Zanzel (dead)]], [[Master Eshmiel Byzant (dead)]], [[Master Beckon of Kulra (dead)]], [[Celia de Luinn]], [[Tyroz]], [[Reliah Lueveen]] and more.
All four masters of the [[Forsaken Ravens]] are here.

[[Rogul]] challenges Voldooron to drink, but Voldooron isn't feeling up for it because of all of the big-shots at the party.
I sat with Dubh and Zanzel. She's a mage the group met just before I joined. She pranked Dubh xD
I have a drinking match with Zanzel, who often drinks with [[Rogul]].

Celia has heard about two luxodon working as guards for a king, they were around the same age as [[Voldooron]] and started working there around the same time as he got separated from his family.

Pandelume and Whitmoore suddenly notice something weird. Dubh get a weird feeling and starts feeling the creatures from his nightmare. [[Grey Haven]] from the mages of divinity shows up. Celia doesn't get time stopped and stands up. Suddenly 3 [[Nuali Hunters]] show up and silence spells gets cast. A golden winged creature appears from out the windows.
Grey Haven is holding the masters of the ravens in a spell. Celia casts power word kill on Pandelume and he's dead. She tells maeve that he cannot live because of what he knows.
We attack the intruders, but Celia is trying to get Maeve to let them kill all the Ravens.
[[Master forklite]] rides the golden creature towards the restaurant and a huge sky ship. It's the mages of divinity.
It's chaos, all the Ravens die, all the masters, Rogul and Zanzel.
Dubh gets teleported by Whitmoore and I jump into the portal. We end up in Whitmoore's place and we see Reliah and 2 other people, all armed looking at us. We know onw of the guys, who we met with the gnolls in the huntmans domain, [[Markus Meredicus]].

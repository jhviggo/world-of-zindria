We left the [[Ashen Kin]] camp with two hunters, going towards the cave where [[Master Whitmoore]] should be residing.
One of the hunters taught voldooron how to catch some scorpion creature to eat and we saw a frog/lizard creature which often finds water. So we can follow them for water.

Voldooron extracted some poison from the scorpion and got a vial of itchy hallucination.

We set up camp and stayed the night. The morning after we continued towards to cave again. As we move forward there are more signs of dangerous creatures. We see ballistas up on the cliffs. There are also signs of a lot of movement and creatures moving through the area we walk. As we make it a bit further there are a bunch of spike walls out in the open, making a choke-point in the canyon. 
This is a camp and there's blood around the area. There are clear signs of struggle but there are no people there. Something is not right. There are arrows in the spike walls. They are gnoll arrows.
Some of the walls are bend and from some huge creature, likely a large troll.

We sneak into the camp and there's a large ogre and a bunch of gnolls.

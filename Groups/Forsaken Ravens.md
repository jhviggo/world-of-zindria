The [[Forsaken Ravens]] is a group that gathers magic. Starting in [[Iridium]] the Masters of the Ravens were students in the same year. [[Master Pandelume (dead)]], [[Master Whitmoore (dead)]] and two more [[Becken]] and [[Elia]]. They were all very good at their perspective magics learning much knowledge of the Arcana. They realized that the university was withholding knowledge from the world. They didn't think that was fair, so they grouped together. They were smuggling books out of the university giving them to people leaving iridium, until one of the professors at the university found out. This professor is now part of the mages of divinity. A lot of students were part of the group, but they became fewer and fewer. But they kept going until one of the students died due to the conflicts. Afterwards the masters were banished from Iridium, but they didn't have any money.
[[Master Whitmoore (dead)]] kept at it and kept researching on his own.
[[Master Pandelume (dead)]] joined a school and eventually found a sponsor for the Ravens. They wanted to help with food, housing and such. The only catch was that they could only be in contact with the sponsor. Pandaloon was the only one who knew where the money came from. At this point the ravens had  multiple hideouts and lots of members.
The sponsors also wanted a future favor, which the Ravens could not say no to. Master Pandelume also found something secret in the Crimson Savana, which could harm the mages of divinity.
The favor finally came and was simply to distract the mages of divinity, so the sponsor could sneak something past them. That's why the mages are now hunting us, because the Ravens got their attention and they're hunting Dubh.
From what Whitmoore knows, the sponsors succede whatever they were doing.

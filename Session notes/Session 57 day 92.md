We wake up in the inn and downstairs we see the owner [[Marcia Bellhaven]] and a larger bard, with a rapier and an instrument, talking. The owner suggests we meet [[Sully]], the bard, to help us to [[Crossguard]]. He offers to drive us in his caravan with his wife, who's a strong fighter.
We go out to the caravan area and see a very large gate in the city wall, where the caravans can enter through.

The caravan is pulled by large Rhino-looking creatures.
Inside the caravan we meet the wife, a green-skinned half-orc cooking dinner. By her side there's a battle axe.

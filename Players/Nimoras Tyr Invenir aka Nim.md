Nim is a fairly shy male elf in semi shabby clothes, asking if we can keep him in our group for a while. He has studied in [[Iridium]] as an arcane spell caster and was sponsored by house of [[sherwood]]. He is not connected to the [[Mages of Divinity]].

He studied in [[Iridium]] but didn't grow up there.

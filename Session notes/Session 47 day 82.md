We leave Lorium in the morning and continue towards Gradia. Dubh realizes that one more of the [[Forsaken Ravens]] might be alive, as they knew a guardsman who wasn't at the party at [[Aroma Atlas]]. It's the guard that Dubh met at the Mansion that taught him to use a crossbow.
Dubh goes up to tell a story to [[Rafael von brokli]] and tell him about all that happened with the Ravens and [[Zanzel (dead)]].
Rafael mentions that Mudwip has being engulfed by the surrounding woods, but the trees feel ominous or odd. He also tells other stories of where he has been.
We get to a lumbering town, Gradia, where we see larger houses built from Lumber and it almost blends into the nearby woods and surroundings. In the town center there's a large bell tower, in a wooden tower with a golden bell at the top. It's later in the day and people are stopping their work, so we'll stay here a few hours before driving for Mudwip through the night.
Ez goes out foraging and found some food.
I went to talk to some of the local birds and they told me that the forest is growing and that it's weird, it feels strange.
Dubh goes into an inn, where he sees patrons trying to hammer a nail into a wooden pillar as a drinking game. And there so real bar, you just get the bear and throw some coin into the basket. There's also another game, where people throw axes at the nail, and it's quite competitive between the lumberjacks.
A man in the inn mentions that weird trees have been popping up around the area and especially from Mudwip and Ashbalt Forest. The people have been cutting down the trees but they're not happy about it and report weird things like eyes. He also mentions [[Harperheim]] a famous bards college.
We continue towards Mudwip.

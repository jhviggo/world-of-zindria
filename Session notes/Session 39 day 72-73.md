After killing the two dragons we head towards the nearby cavern to hide.

DON'T CASE 3RD LEVEL SPELLS! THE STORM WILL FUCK WITH IT! Maeve's heal almost killed me with necrotic damage, because of the storm.

After a greater short-rest we continue towards Dubh's ping. As we walk Voldooron smells for animals around but he doesn't sense any, but he sees that the plants around are a little strange. Some of the plants can only be found in small specific areas, they have little areas where they're the only plants. There's a bunch of different biomes of unique plants.

We went further and found another cave to rest in, but it was quite deep. We walk down into the cave and found an arch with carvings on it. Dubh sensed some weak magic to deter animals. He sent Ruru further in and the arches continued. We get into a huge room with holes in the roof for sun-light. But since it's evening the moon shines through. The holes have arches too and the holes don't seem to be placed randomly, they probably have another purpose.
Dubh investigated the holes and it seem that they're intended for the sun being in specific locations in the sky to shine through. Maybe it's a sun dial or meant to illuminate certain areas and specific times.
Maeve lights up the bottom of a staircase and there are ruins of very old houses. There are vases, crates and remnants of wood and fabric across the floor and walls. The pictograms on the walls are of humanoid cats like Tabaxi or Leonin.
This place seems to be at least 1000 years old.
We set up a camp in an open area and rest. However, as I only sleep 4 hours I decide to walk around the city and find a huge main street. I it leads to a larger special looking way with bigger arches and a larger staircase leading upwards. The buildings around a bigger. I go up stairs and find a collapsed bridge and a grand temple further up the stairs. It's a huge construction being caved out of the mountain. I also see a blue shimmering siluette standing in the arch and moving around.
As dawn comes around we see the sunlight come into the cave and illuminate the scale of the city inside the cave. It's huuuuge. We see the grand temple with a large wall around it.
We all start heading towards the temple. As we get to the  main road Dubh hears kids laughter behind him but there's nothing around him. He hears noises and people around him.
The noises are old memories, not his memories but somebody's memories.
As go get up to the entrance of the temple we see some blue Leonin ghosts with spears. They see us but don't do anything, they just move up to the temple entrance and stand guard.
The guards are wearing ceremonial robes and some kind of armor.
We go further in into a larger hall. We all hear the noises as if there's a market around us.
In the temple we see the same symbol we saw earlier on one of the arches. It's two hands giving something like a gem towards the viewer, and the hands have eyes on their palms.
We go into the inner sanctum and there are hundreds of pillars holding up the roof and there are weird carvings on the pillars. They don't really make any sense, there are tons of marking and symbols, but they don't seem random. We also see writing on the floor leading up towards a plateau.
The writing says "Halls of Memorial".
We go to the end of the hall and turn around. We now see all the random markings on the pillars is actually a large art piece with writing in Leonin.
It's a poem with drawings under each section. The () are what the drawings show.
```
First there was one, then many followed
A droplet became the rain, the rivers we swallowed
(A droplet of purer sunlight falls from the heaven and is caught by a river. The river flows into the meadows and savannah landscape, from the grassland people arise, the leonin and tabaxi race)

A pack of one, under the eyes of four
Their creators gave upon them, a world to explore
(Four heavenly eyes peak through the clouds Symbols of divine illuminate the waste expands of the savannah)

To honor them, the masons erected
The Temples of Exordium, to feel connected
(Masons being picked up, temples being carved out of stone walls)

Mighty beneath the savannah they stand
masons now clergy, temples now manned
(Finalized immense monuments and temples with the masons dropping their tools and instead take upon cloaks of clergy)

Living amongst the presence of creation
the temples became, the clans foundation
(People flocking to the temples and the empty halls being filled with settlements)

Meadows bloomed as kin united
The heavens split as champions were cited
(Clergy performing a ritual and four eyes shine upon a singular indivual)

Amongst the temples few stood tall
four were chosen, leaders forestall
(a grand ground around the clergy and four individuals standing)

The first fangs, chieftains of a the savannah
The first to rise, chieftain Fianna
(A woman standing in the savannah alone, holding a singular blade to the sky)

Soon followed Sunderlin and his sons
loyal to their creators and kin cultures greatest patrons
(A group with a singular leader, people forming a circle and exchanging what looks like medals/necklaces)

Far he roamed, Beast kin Ra'tir the expander
chosen by creators for something much grander
(A pack of hunters, crouched in the savannah tall crass looking out over the fields of unexplored regions)

Many followed the last to arise
Pack leader Raz'ir the wise
(People flocking to a singular person that points one hand to the sky and another forwards indicating his leadership by the gods)

Forebode the arise of turmoil, the creators could not ignore
the kin was being prepared for more
(The horizon of the savannah but a darkness envolpes the very peak)

Stand tall, this is the Memorial hall
Eyes are upon us, the savannah will not forget us all
(United in few, Banner being risen in the very hall they stand in)
```

Dubh recognizes some of the names of the clans that still exist today. Dubh's clan was called [[Raz'ir]] and they're mentioned in the peom!
There are also two symbols by the poems at that we don't recognize.
Maeve recognizes one of the symbols, it's the symbol of her god. The symbol is marked something like "[[Fawnes the Great]]. Emporer of the elven kin and part of the fey realm" the poems suggests that the emporer is one of the creators.
The symbol is a elongated helmet. Like a four-eyed axe beak.

The temple is called [[Temples of Exortium]] indicating that there are multiple temples.
